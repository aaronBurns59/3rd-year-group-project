## Module Description
"This module is intended to bring together many of the best practices that the student has learned in theprevious semesters. It give the student an opportunity to design, develop and deploy a project, eitherindividually or in a group environment, delivering a piece of software in a timely and standards driven manner."


## How to Run the project
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.0

+ Development Server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

+ Code Scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

+ Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

+ Running Unit Tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

+ Running End-To-End Tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).


## Introduction
Our Project is an Angular based online clothes shop website. Our goal was to create a website with which users could browse a selection of items of clothing on sale from various sellers. Products include a Description, Price, Brand, Condition, Seller Name and Contact Info. The Project includes CRUD functionality, meaning users can Create, Update, Read and Delete the data stored on mLab.


## Technologies Used

+ Angular - A TypeScript based open-source web-application framework.

+ Node.js - An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

+ Express - A web application framework for Node.js designed for building we applications and APIs.

+ Mongo - A cross-platform document-oriented database program, classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents.
 
+ mLab - A fully managed cloud database service that hosts MongoDB databases and runs on AWS Google and Azure cloud providers.


## Design Methodology

We decided that the Waterfall Methodology would best suit our approach to working on the project. Each stage of the project would follow eachother sequentially downwards. When one stage was completed they were essentially set in stone and would remain unchanged until all other stages were complete. 
The five stages involved in this Methodology and how we practiced them are:
1. Requirements - Deciding what is needed
2. Design - Decide how development on the project would proceed
3. Implementation - The bulk of project development is completed during this stage. This consisted of developing each feature of the program
4. Verification - Testing phase to ensure implemented code worked as planned in the Design phase
5. Maintenance - Going over implemented features to alter and update functionality
